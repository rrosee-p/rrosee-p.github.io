            <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
            <ul>
                        <li>A CSS media query lets you apply styles only when certain conditions (like screen width, resolution, or orientation) are met. They’re useful because they make websites responsive, ensuring layouts and designs adapt smoothly to different devices like phones, tablets, and desktops.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they do?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Max-width / min-width – Targets screens based on their width. For example, max-width: 600px applies styles only when the viewport is 600px wide or smaller (often used for mobile screens).</li>
                        <li>Orientation – Checks if the device is in portrait (taller than wide) or landscape (wider than tall) mode.</li>
                        <li>Resolution – Targets the pixel density of a device, such as high-DPI screens (min-resolution: 300dpi for Retina displays).</li>
                        <li>Prefers-color-scheme – Detects if the user’s system preference is set to light mode or dark mode, allowing automatic theme switching.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
