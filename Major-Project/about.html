    <h2>Hi, I'm Rose Pineda</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve been passionate about photography for many years, capturing moments that tell a story and 
      preserving memories for my clients. My style blends creativity, authenticity, and fun—so every 
      session feels natural and enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I’ve worked with families, couples, and individuals to create photos that truly 
      reflect their personality and the joy in their lives. Whether it’s a milestone, a celebration, or 
      just a special day, I strive to make every session memorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you book with me, you’re not just getting photos—you’re getting an experience. I believe in 
      creating a comfortable environment where you can be yourself and have fun while I capture these 
      moments.
