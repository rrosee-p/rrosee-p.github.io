    <h2>The Orchard</h2>
    <p>My family’s orchard sat at the end of a dusty road. Apple trees stretched in rows, blooming early every spring. The air always smelled like blossoms and warm soil.</p>

  <section class="step">
    <h2>Seasons of Work</h2>
    <p>We learned to prune branches in winter and gather apples in the fall. Every season asked for patience. Every tree felt like an old friend.</p>

    <h2>The Letter</h2>
    <p>One day, a letter arrived. A company wanted the land. They said the orchard was “outdated.” They promised something “more modern.” But some things can’t be replaced.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="step">
    <h2>The Choice</h2>
    <p>We chose to keep the orchard. It’s smaller now, and harder to maintain. But when the wind moves through the leaves, it sounds like every memory is still alive.</p>
